              bug or something caused during deployment.

              The entire test design phase takes place before the code is

              actually moved to the environment. It’s the test execution that

              depends on the code availability in the QA environment while the

              Deployment team works on getting the code deployed in QA, the QA

              team should ensure to have completed below activities:

            <h1  className="mt-[10px] text-[25px]"> Ensure the test cases are reviewed and approved</h1>

              After deployment, QA team started with our Sanity test. But before

              we start our sanity test, we should ensure following has been

              taken care:

            </li>

            <h1  className="mt-[10px] text-[25px]">

               The QA team should have received notification from the

              deployment team about successful deployment and ready for QA.

            </h1>

            <h1  className="mt-[10px] text-[25px]"> The QA team should keep a track of the deployed build.</h1>

            <h1  className="mt-[10px] text-[25px]">

              Make sure the QA team has the list of changes successfully

              deployed and also of items not deployed even if they were planned.

              It may happen that the deployment team couldn’t deploy due to

              missing details etc

            <h1 className="font-bold text-[30px]">Build Versioning::</h1>

            <h1  className="mt-[10px] text-[25px]">

              Build Versioning should be added on every build deployment on

              product to track the how many builds are deployed in QA Instance.

              Build versioning is important as it will help QA team to Sign off

              on respective build. It there is fall back they can revert to

              previous build to continue testing.
